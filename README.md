# SwiftTemplate

The purpose of this project is to avoid repetition when creating a new swift project.
Every time I do the same things over and over again:

Create the project, delete the storyboards, make a clean hierarchy, add the SnapKit and SwiftLint pods, etc...

# Informations

This template includes the following features:
- A clean folder hierarchy
- No storyboards
- SwiftLint
- SnapKit for constraints
- Convenient extensions (See [Extensions/](https://github.com/R3J3CT3D/SwiftTemplate/tree/master/SwiftTemplate/SwiftTemplate/Helpers/Extensions))
- And many others...

# Installation

1. Press the `Use this template` button at the top of this page (See: [Creating a repository from a template](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template))

2. From your repository, go to `SwiftTemplate/` and launch the `project-renamer` with the choosen name as argument
```
./swift-renamer.swift your-project-name
```

3. Double click on the `.xcworkspace`, if Xcode displays an error message such as `Cannot open file`, press `Ok`, then close Xcode and reopen the `.xcworkspace`

4. You're good to go!
